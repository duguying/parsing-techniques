# 2.1.3 Problems with Infinite Sets

The above definition of a language as a possibly infinite set of sequences of symbols and of a grammar as a finite recipe to generate these sentences immediately gives rise to two embarrassing questions:

1. How can finite recipes generate enough infinite sets of sentences?

2. If a sentence is just a sequence and has no structure and if the meaning of a sentence derives, among other things, from its structure, how can we assess the meaning of a sentence?

These questions have long and complicated answers, but they do have answers. We shall first pay some attention to the first question and then devote the main body of this book to the second.


### 2.1.3.1 Infinite Sets from Finite Descriptions

In fact there is nothing wrong with getting a single infinite set from a single finite description: “the set of all positive integers” is a very finite-size description of a definitely infinite-size set. Still, there is something disquieting about the idea, so we shall rephrase our question: “Can all languages be described by finite descriptions?” As the lead-up already suggests, the answer is “No”, but the proof is far from trivial. It is, however, very interesting and famous, and it would be a shame not to present at least an outline of it here.

### 2.1.3.2 Descriptions can be Enumerated

The proof is based on two observations and a trick. The first observation is that descriptions can be listed and given a number. This is done as follows. First, take all descriptions of size one, that is, those of only one letter long, and sort them alphabetically. This is the beginning of our list. Depending on what, exactly, we accept as a description, there may be zero descriptions of size one, or 27 (all letters + space), or 95 (all printable ASCII characters) or something similar; this is immaterial to the discussion which follows.

Second, we take all descriptions of size two, sort them alphabetically to give the second chunk on the list, and so on for lengths 3, 4 and further. This assigns a position on the list to each and every description. Our description “the set of all positive integers”, for example, is of size 32, not counting the quotation marks. To find its position on the list, we have to calculate how many descriptions there are with less than 32 characters, say L. We then have to generate all descriptions of size 32, sort them and determine the position of our description in it, say P, and add the two numbers L and P. This will, of course, give a huge number[^1] but it does ensure that the description is on the list, in a well-defined position; see Figure 2.1.

Two things should be pointed out here. The first is that just listing all descriptions alphabetically, without reference to their lengths, would not do: there are already infinitely many descriptions starting with an “a” and no description starting with a higher letter could get a number on the list. The second is that there is no need to actually do all this. It is just a thought experiment that allows us to examine and draw conclusions about the behavior of a system in a situation which we cannot possibly examine physically.

Also, there will be many nonsensical descriptions on the list; it will turn out that this is immaterial to the argument. The important thing is that all meaningful descriptions are on the list, and the above argument ensures that.

### 2.1.3.3 Languages are Infinite Bit-Strings

We know that words (sentences) in a language are composed of a finite set of symbols; this set is called quite reasonably the “alphabet”. We will assume that the symbols in the alphabet are ordered. Then the words in the language can be ordered too. We shall indicate the alphabet by Σ.

Now the simplest language that uses alphabet Σ is that which consists of all words that can be made by combining letters from the alphabet. For the alphabet Σ ={a, b} we get the language { , a, b, aa, ab, ba, bb, aaa, . . . }.We shall call this language Σ∗, for reasons to be explained later; for the moment it is just a name.

The set notation Σ∗ above started with “ { , a,”, a remarkable construction; the first word in the language is the empty word, the word consisting of zero as and zero bs. There is no reason to exclude it, but, if written down, it may easily be overlooked, so we shall write it as ε (epsilon), regardless of the alphabet. So, Σ∗ = { ε, a, b, aa, ab, ba, bb, aaa, . . . }. In some natural languages, forms of the present tense of the verb “to be” are empty words, giving rise to sentences of the form “I student”, meaning “I am a student.” Russian and Hebrew are examples of this.

Since the symbols in the alphabet Σ are ordered, we can list the words in the language Σ∗, using the same technique as in the previous section: First, all words of size zero, sorted; then all words of size one, sorted; and so on. This is actually the order already used in our set notation for Σ∗.

The language Σ∗ has the interesting property that all languages using alphabet Σ are subsets of it. That means that, given another possibly less trivial language over Σ, called L, we can go through the list of words in Σ∗ and put ticks on all words that are in L. This will cover all words in L, since Σ∗ contains any possible word over Σ.

Suppose our language L is “the set of all words that contain more as than bs”. L is the set {a, aa, aab, aba, baa, . . . }. The beginning of our list, with ticks, will look as follows:

[图2](ebook/img/2.1.3.3 图2.png)


Given the alphabet with its ordering, the list of blanks and ticks alone is entirely sufficient to identify and describe the language. For convenience we write the blank as a 0 and the tick as a 1 as if they were bits in a computer, and we can now write L = 0101000111010001· · · (and Σ∗ = 1111111111111111· · · ). It should be noted that this is true for any language, be it a formal language like L, a programming language like Java or a natural language like English. In English, the 1s in the bitstring will be very scarce, since hardly any arbitrary sequence of words is a good English sentence (and hardly any arbitrary sequence of letters is a good English word, depending on whether we address the sentence/word level or the word/letter level).

### 2.1.3.4 Diagonalization

The previous section attaches the infinite bit-string 0101000111010001· · · to the description “the set of all the words that contain more as than bs”. In the same vein we can attach such bit-strings to all descriptions. Some descriptions may not yield a language, in which case we can attach an arbitrary infinite bit-string to it. Since all descriptions can be put on a single numbered list, we get, for example, the following picture:




At the left we have all descriptions, at the right all languages they describe. We now claim that many languages exist that are not on the list of languages above: the above list is far from complete, although the list of descriptions is complete.We shall prove this by using the diagonalization process (“Diagonalverfahren”) of Cantor.

Consider the language C = 100110· · · , which has the property that its n-th bit is unequal to the n-th bit of the language described by Description #n. The first bit of C is a 1, because the first bit for Description #1 is a 0; the second bit of C is a 0, because the second bit for Description #2 is a 1, and so on. C is made by walking the NW to SE diagonal of the language field and copying the opposites of the bits we meet. This is the diagonal in Figure 2.2(a). The language C cannot be on the list! It cannot be on line 1, since its first bit differs (is made to differ, one should say) from that on line 1, and in general it cannot be on line n, since its n-th bit will differ from that on line n, by definition.

So, in spite of the fact that we have exhaustively listed all possible finite descriptions, we have at least one language that has no description on the list. But there exist more languages that are not on the list. Construct, for example, the language whose n+10-th bit differs from the n+10-th bit in Description #n. Again it cannot be on the list since for every n > 0 it differs from line n in the n+10-th bit. But that means that bits 1. . . 9 play no role, and can be chosen arbitrarily, as shown in Figure 2.2(b); this yields another 29 = 512 languages that are not on the list. And we can do even much better than that! Suppose we construct a language whose 2n-th bit differs from the 2n-th bit in Description #n (c). Again it is clear that it cannot be on the list, but now every odd bit is left unspecified and can be chosen freely! This allows us to create freely an infinite number of languages none of which allows a finite description; see the slanting diagonal in Figure 2.2. In short, for every language that can be described there are infinitely many that cannot.

The diagonalization technique is described more formally in most books on theoretical computer science; see e.g., Rayward-Smith [393, pp. 5-6], or Sudkamp [397, Section 1.4].

### 2.1.3.5 Discussion

The above demonstration shows us several things. First, it shows the power of treating languages as formal objects. Although the above outline clearly needs considerable amplification and substantiation to qualify as a proof (for one thing it still has to be clarified why the above explanation, which defines the language C, is not itself on the list of descriptions; see Problem 2.1, it allows us to obtain insight into properties not otherwise assessable.

Secondly, it shows that we can only describe a tiny subset (not even a fraction) of all possible languages: there is an infinity of languages out there, forever beyond our reach.

Thirdly, we have proved that, although there are infinitely many descriptions and infinitely many languages, these infinities are not equal to each other, and the latter is larger than the former. These infinities are called ℵ0 and ℵ1 by Cantor, and the above is just a special case of his proof that ℵ0 < ℵ1.
