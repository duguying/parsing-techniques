# 4.1.1 Unger’s Method without ε-Rules or Loops

To see how Unger’s method solves the parsing problem, let us consider a small example. Suppose we have a grammar rule 

S→ABC | DE | F

and we want to find out whether S derives the input sentence pqrs. The initial parsing problem can then be schematically represented as:

![图1](../../img/4.1.1_1.png)

For each right-hand side we must first generate all possible partitions of the input sentence. Generating partitions is not difficult: if we have m cups, numbered from 1 to m, and n marbles, numbered from 1 to n, we have to find all possible partitions such that each cup contains at least one marble, the numbers of the marbles in any cup are consecutive, and any cup does not contain lower-numbered marbles than any marble in a lower-numbered cup. We proceed as follows: first, we put marble 1 in cup 1, and then generate all partitions of the other n−1 marbles over the other m−1 cups. This gives us all partitions that have marble 1 and only marble 1 in the first cup. Next, we put marbles 1 and 2 in the first cup, and then generate all partitions of the other n−2 marbles over the other m−1 cups, etc. If n is less than m, no partition is possible.

Partitioning the input corresponds to partitioning the marbles (the input symbols) over the cups (the right-hand side symbols). If a right-hand side has more symbols than the sentence, no partition can be found (there being no ε-rules). For the first right-hand side the following partitions must be tried:

![图2](../../img/4.1.1_2.png)

The first partition results in the following sub-problems: does A derive p, does B derive q, and does C derive rs? These sub-problems must all be answered in the affirmative, or the partition is not the right one.

For the second right-hand side, we obtain the following partitions:

The last right-hand side results in the following partition:

All these sub-problems deal with shorter sentences, except the last one. They will all lead to similar split-ups, and in the end many will fail because a terminal symbol in a right-hand side does not match the corresponding part of the partition. The only partition that causes some concern is the last one. It is as complicated as the one we started with. This is the reason that we have disallowed loops in the grammar. If the grammar has loops, we may get the original problem back again and again. For example, if there is a rule F →S in the example above, this will certainly happen.

The above demonstrates that we have a search problem here, and we can attack it with either the depth-first or the breadth-first search technique (see Section 3.5.2). Unger uses depth-first search.

In the following discussion, the grammar of Figure 4.1 will serve as an example. This grammar represents the language of simple arithmetic expressions, with opera-

![图5](../../img/4.1.1_5-Fig.4.1.png)

tors + and ×, and operand i. We will use the sentence (i+i)×i as input example. So the initial problem can be represented as:

![图6](../../img/4.1.1_6.png)

Fitting the first alternative of Expr with the input (i+i)×i results in a list of 15 partitions, shown in Figure 4.2. We will not examine them all here, although the unoptimized version of the algorithm requires this.We will only examine the partitions that have at least some chance of succeeding: we can eliminate all partitions that do not match the terminal symbol of the right-hand side. So the only partition worth investigating further is:

![图7](../../img/4.1.1_7-Fig.4.2.png)

![图8](../../img/4.1.1_8.png)

The first sub-problem here is to find out whether and, if so, how Expr derives (i. We cannot partition (i into three non-empty parts because it only consists of 2 symbols. Therefore, the only rule that we can apply is the rule Expr--->Term. Similarly, the only rule that we can apply next is the rule Term--->Factor. So we now have

![图9](../../img/4.1.1_9.png)

However, this is impossible, because the first right-hand side of Factor has too many symbols, and the second one consists of one terminal symbol only. Therefore, the partition we started with does not fit, and it must be rejected. The other partitions were already rejected, so we can conclude that the rule Expr--->Expr+Term does not derive the input.

The second right-hand side of Expr consists of only one symbol, so we only have one partition here, consisting of one part. Partitioning this part for the first right-hand side of Term again results in 15 possibilities, of which again only one has a chance of succeeding:

![图10](../../img/4.1.1_10.png)

Continuing our search, we will find the following derivation (the only one to be found):

![图11](../../img/4.1.1_11.png)

This example demonstrates several aspects of the method: even small examples require a considerable amount of work, but even some simple checks can result in huge savings. For example, matching the terminal symbols in a right-hand side with the partition at hand often leads to the rejection of the partition without investigating it any further. Unger [12] presents several more of these checks. For example, one can compute the minimum length of strings of terminal symbols derivable from each non-terminal. Once it is known that a certain non-terminal only derives terminal strings of length at least n, all partitions that fit this non-terminal with a substring of length less than n can be immediately rejected.
